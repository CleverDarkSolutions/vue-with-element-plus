Website available at https://vue-et.herokuapp.com/

Disclaimer: The website is in development stage.

This website is a visual design challenge after I was unsatisfied with my first Vue project.
For once I wanted to focus more on appearance than on number of functionalities.
I use ElementPlus library, because it's compatible with Vue 3 and easy to use.


Special thanks to Vue Land discord community.
